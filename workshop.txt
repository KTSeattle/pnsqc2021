Exercises
--------------
#1) Fork the workshop Repo from my account on Github 
Go here:
https://github.com/mxmoss/pnsqc2021

Click on the [Fork] button

Explore the fork of the project in your repo 

#2) Clone the project locally
a) Open a terminal to use the git command line

To start a Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows:
(Windows: [ctrl]+[Esc] | Cmd | [enter])  

To open a terminal in macOS:
(MacOS: [Command]+[Space] | Terminal.app | [Enter])

From the command prompt, type 'git' and press return to verify that git is installed

b) Clone the project onto your computer
git clone https://github.com/<yourgithub>/pnsqc2021.git  
where <yourgithub> is your github account name.

eg: my account name is mxmoss.
so: git clone https://github.com/mxmoss/pnsqc2021.git  

You should see something like:
  Cloning into 'pnsqc2021'...
  remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
  remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
  remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
  Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
  Checking connectivity... done.

c) Verify that the files are local

dir pnsqc2021 

cd pnsqc2021

Try some git commands:
  git (with no parameters) 
  git help -g
  git help -a
  git status 
  git config 


#3) Create a local file, commit changes and push to your repo 

Part 1) Add a feature
We don't want to disrupt production, so we're going to create a branch for working on this. 
git checkout -b my-feat1
Should respond with:
Switched to a new branch 'my-feat1'

//Also, we need to set configuration - email and username
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name

//Now I'm free to do whatever I want in my branch. I can't affect production without commit back to the 'main' branch (production)

a) Create the file index.md 
Windows: notepad index.md 
Linux: vim index.md
Linux: nano index.md 
MacOS: You can use vim, nano or TextEdit (GUI) 

 edit the file 
# PNSQC 2021 Workshop
- This is my first github pages feature

Save 

c) Let's check your work 
- You have a file 
Run a git status:
C:\temp\workshop\pnsqc2021>git status
On branch moss-feat1
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        index.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Oops, this file isn't being tracked. 
And we're on the main branch. 
Let's fix this:
git checkout -b myfirst-feat
git add index.md 
git status 

Now you can run
git status 

//Commit it
git commit -m "my first commit"
[moss-feat1 123d2c4] my first feature
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.md
 
//
push to remote repository
