Exercises
--------------
#1) Fork the workshop Repo from my account on Github 
https://github.com/mxmoss/pnsqc2021

Explore the github account 


#2) Clone the project locally
a) Make a space for working on your project locally
I'm using a directory called 'workshop' under the 'temp' directory on a windows system 
open Terminal in macOS or Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows.
(Windows: [ctrl]+[Esc] | Cmd | [enter])  
(MacOS: [Command]+[Space] | Terminal.app | [Enter])

Just work in the current directory 

//C:\Users\moss>mkdir \temp\workshop
//C:\Users\moss>cd \temp\workshop

b) clone it
C:\temp\workshop>git clone https://github.com/comicsbin/pnsqc2021.git
Cloning into 'pnsqc2021'...

c) verify 
Now you can see your files are copied locally 

C:\temp\workshop>dir pnsqc2021
